# 🚨 AI Crowd Management System – Smart Crowd Safety

### 📡 Real-Time Overcrowding Detection & Instant Alerts via CCTV + AI

---

## 📘 Overview

The **AI Crowd Management System** is a real-time video analytics solution that integrates with existing CCTV infrastructure to detect **overcrowding** in public spaces. It sends instant alerts to security authorities, helping them **prevent stampedes**, **divert foot traffic**, and **save lives**—all without manual monitoring.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Managing crowds in real-time is difficult:

- 🚶‍♂️ Thousands gather during festivals, rallies, or sports events.
- 👁️ Control rooms can't monitor 20+ camera feeds efficiently.
- 🕑 By the time someone notices a critical crowd situation—it's already late.

**We solve this** using AI to analyze camera feeds 24/7, detect when a crowd becomes dense, and alert the right people instantly.

## 💡 Our AI-Powered Solution

✅ **Monitors crowd density** using AI on live CCTV video  
✅ **Counts or estimates** the number of people in defined zones  
✅ **Compares** crowd levels to safety thresholds  
✅ **Sends real-time alerts** (dashboard, email, SMS, push)  
✅ **Visualizes danger zones** on an interactive map

## 🧠 System Workflow

1. 🎥 CCTV Camera captures video in public zones  
2. 📡 Video stream sent via RTSP to AI server  
3. 🧠 AI Engine processes frames:
   - 👥 **Object Detection** for light crowds (YOLOv8, SSD)
   - 🌈 **Density Estimation** for heavy crowds (CNN Heatmaps)
4. 📏 Rule Engine checks thresholds per zone  
5. 🚨 Alert triggered if threshold is breached  
6. 🧑‍✈️ Authorities receive real-time alert on web dashboard  
7. 🧭 Action is taken (reroute crowd, dispatch officers, etc.)
